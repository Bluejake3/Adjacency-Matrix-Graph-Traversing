# Overview
This programs generate an adjacency matrix by using the `rand()` function. Users are provided by some menus that operate the randomized adjacency matrix. Some of the operation are printing, searching minimum distance, and searching maximum distance.

# Function List
* `void printmap(int map[M][M]);` for printing the matrix.
* `void dijkstra(int G[M][M],int n,int startnode, int endnode);` for searching the minimum distance of two nodes.
* `void maxdistance(int G[M][M], int startnode, int endnode);` for searching the maximum distance two nodes.
* `void takemin(int G[M][M], int startnode, int endnode);` for searching the distance of two nodes while visiting all nodes and always take the minimum path.
* `void takemax(int G[M][M], int startnode, int endnode);'`for searching the distance of two nodes and always take the maximum path until the end of the path is the destination node.

# How it Works
Before the program prints the menu, an adjacency matrix is generated by using the `rand()` function. To maintain the distance on the list always on 1-100 range, we operate the result of `rand()` function by 100 and add it by 1. Then,
